## BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL imports
##
## To use the Python MoveIt interfaces, we will import the `moveit_commander`_ namespace.
## This namespace provides us with a `MoveGroupCommander`_ class, a `PlanningSceneInterface`_ class,
## and a `RobotCommander`_ class. More on these below. We also import `rospy`_ and some messages that we will use:

        ## If you are using a different robot, change this value to the name of your robot
        ## arm planning group.
        ## This interface can be used to plan and execute motions:
